Hello! My name is Andrea Gergel, I work primarily in the Python language on data science projects for my company. I work on projects in order to move and transform data from many sources as well as creating reporting solutions for teams to view their data.

In the past I've used both powerBi and Tableau in order to create reports. I have set up and maintained Tableau Server, SQL Server, and Google bigQuery. I have used products to transform and analyze data such as Alteryx, Tableau Prep, and Machine Learning Studio in addition to Python and R languages.
